# Hello-World
Repository will hold all new JavaScript Learning Materials and Questions in order to teach myself coding - Javascript, CSS and C++
I have always wanted to learn coding or programming.  My interest started years ago with C++.  I never could find a compiler...lol.  So I gave up.  Now, everything is on the net.  I have found lots of great resources.  I still don't understand coding.  It's like Greek to me.  However I found a great series of books, You Dont Know JS, which is helping me understand...slowing but surely along with GitHub.  Thanks.
